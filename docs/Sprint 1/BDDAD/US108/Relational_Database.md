#Why we should use the relational database?

Once we have defined information on all the necessary structures, it is possible to structure a relational model that normalizes the data, defining tables and relationships between them.

Another type would be Non-Relational Database (NoSQL) but we think that in this case, it won't be the best option since we won't be working with something that will be constantly under development (dynamic) or something that needs horizontal scalability.

That said, SQL database is the best option as it gives us a high degree of restrictions and data security. Let's not forget to mention ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) transactions that allow for fast transactions and data integrity.
